      <p>Kim Garam (김가람; or simply Garam) is a former South Korean singer. She is a former member of the girl group LE SSERAFIM.</p>
   
      <h2>Career</h2>
      <h3>2022: LE SSERAFIM</h3>
      <p>On April 5, Garam was introduced as the second member of LE SSERAFIM. They debuted on May 2, 2022 with the mini album Fearless.</p>
      
      <p>
          On July 20, Source Music announced that they had terminated their contract with Garam.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal life</h2>

          <h3>Bullying accusations and departure from LE SSERAFIM</h3>

          <p>
            Following the reveal of Garam as a LE SSERAFIM member on April 5, 2022, bullying allegations appeared against Garam. In response, Source Music (HYBE) stated that the allegations were made to slander Garam's name in a case of defamation and that Garam was a victim of school bullying, resulting in them denying the school bullying rumors.
      </p>
      
      <p>On May 16, a picture of what appears to be an official document of a school violence committee meeting with Garam as the perpetrator was released, along with more evidence. Later that day, HYBE revealed that they are beginning to take legal actions against the slander and that their position from the previous statement had not changed.</p>
      
      <p>On May 19, an alleged victim came forward through their legal representative and said that they were forced to transfer schools and received counseling due to the severe bullying by Garam and her friends. She then had to drop out of her new school due to dealing with extreme anxiety, having panic attacks, and a suicide attempt. The law firm stated that if HYBE maintains their position without a genuine apology to the victim, they will release the full text of the results of the Autonomous Committee for Countermeasures against School Violence, including an outline of the case. HYBE released a statement stating that they will explain their current position at a later date once everything is reviewed and that what is being shared is only a one-sided perspective.</p>
      
      <p>On May 20, Source Music announced that Garam would be taking a break from group activities due to the bullying accusations made against her. Thus, LE SSERAFIM will be carrying out activities as 5 members for the time being until her supposed return. However, Garam was permanently removed from the group on July 20, 2022.</p>
      
      <p>On August 10, Garam made her first statement since her departure through a post uploaded on her friend's Instagram account. She refuted the accusations made, stating that she never hit or assaulted against anyone, been forced to transfer schools, smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol, or bullied anyone. Regarding the disciplinary action she received from the school violence committee, Garam explained that in her first year of middle school, a classmate (referred to as "Yoo") was gossiping and uploading photos of other students in their underwear. Thinking that she was helping the victim, she confronted the classmate and while doing so, also swore. At the time, Garam was not aware of the difference between majority and minority and was unable to deeply understand about why it was wrong to confront Yoo, and looking back admitted that she was immature, that her method was incorrect and made a lot of mistakes, but does not want to hate her past self. HYBE responded to the post on August 11 that due to the termination of her contract, further comments are inappropriate as there is nothing left for them to say.</p>
